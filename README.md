```css
:root {
  --fgColor: #ffffff; /* foreground color */
  --bgColor: #212121; /* background color */
  --linkColor: lightgrey;
  --font: "Roboto"; /* custom font */
  --leftMargin: 10%;
  --LinkBoardContainersPerRow: 3;
  --numberOfBackgroundImages: 11;
  --idxForFixedBackgroundImage: -1; /* if not -1, Background Image will be fixed to certain index */ 
}
```
